# LyOPix Coding

Welcome to **LyOPix Coding**, where all my products are built around one simple principle:

> **You tell me what to build. I build exactly that. No extra details. No hidden features. No surprises.**

## Vision

I'm here to give users full creative control. If you can describe it, I can craft it: pixel-perfect and user-centric.

## What I Build

* Fully custom websites
*  Tailored dashboards & tools
* Lightweight apps with clean UX
* Responsive designs built from scratch
* Zero bloat, zero filler

If you want it **simple**, cool: I got you.
If you want it **complex**, bring it on.
If you want it **weird**, even better.

## My Core Philosophy

### No Guessing

I don’t interpret your request; we follow it.

### No Extras

Features exist *only* if you ask for them.

### Clean Builds

Everything I ship is structured, optimized, and future ready.

### User-Controlled Production

You’re basically the creative director, I'm the dev that executes.

## Project Structure

Here’s how I usually operate:

**1. You Describe**
Tell me what you want — as detailed or minimal as you like.

**2. I Draft**
I outline the build plan based strictly on your instructions.

**3. You Approve**
You confirm it matches your vision.

**4. I Build**
No shortcuts, no last-minute changes unless *you* request them.

**5. You Own It**
It's your project, so you get full control and full access.

## Current Focus (Live Updates)

* Expanding custom site templates
* Increasing delivery speed on user requests
* Testing new UI/UX patterns
* Deploy-ready pipelines for user projects

## How to Work With Me

Want something built? Here’s all you need to do:

1. Reach out with your idea or problem.
2. Tell me exactly what you want.
3. I handle the rest.

If your instructions say “Make it neon pink with a button that bounces like Jell-O,” we’re on it.
If your instructions say “Minimal, clean, simple,” we stick to that.
